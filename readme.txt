lynxous is a home-brewed CMS tailored to link users with others to discuss and develop solutions for local issues globally. The tool is 'styled' to feel similar to a wiki, enabling users to: 

1). create topics, 

2). work with other 'members' of 'topics' to add information to the discussion stream (text),

3). develop local, regional, state/province/district/etc., national or global 'events' that support solutions,

4). schedule 'group activity meetings' to discuss, develop sub-committees, and resolve the logistics for events,  once an event have been created by a member of that topic, using video/audio conferencing combined with tools to aide the live discussion, including; 
	A). a speaker queue w/variable lengths of share time, 
	B). a like/unlike consensus tool with a live visual screen tally (for live vote counts) seen by all members watching (audio for those listening, as well as further development of "access other" if need be), (tally may be reset at any time by the 'current speaker' - defaults to zero with new speaker), 
	C). a video or audio notification panel  activated when that user reaches the top of the queue ( switches to count-down of share time allowed - decided ahead of time by the group ),
	
5). post resources and links related to the Topic or Events in support of that topic,

6). share topics and events using social media links to recruit support for each topic users are members of, using 'throw-cards' with an intro to the topic.
